Building a mini network for FridayHITT 

Description: 
A small company FridayHITT provide customised different HITT
training every Friday with running routes local to your location. They have
approached you to design a mini network for the online presence. They can see
that the company will expand rapidly so they want the design to be extensible
from the start. They know that applying good practices from the start will
make this easier. Provide appropriate services and documentation to get them going.
